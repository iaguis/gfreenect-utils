GFreenect Utils
================

This project offers some utilities to used with GFreenect.

It currently provides two tools:

Record Depth File
==================

*record-depth-file*

A tool that uses GFreenect to control the Kinect and lets
you record a file containing the depth buffer information.

Instructions are shown in the program's window.

Depth File Viewer
==================

*depth-file-viewer*

A tool that shows the depth image represented by the depth
files recorded by the tool above.
It supports optional command line arguments to highlight
given points with a color.

The following example shows the file named "depth-file-name"
with the points at 200,300 and 150,250 highlighted as a
green and a red square, respectively:

  $ depth-file-viewer depth-file-name \#00ff00 200 300 \#ff0000 150 250
